# Appointment Service

A microservice for managing appointments in the Patient Management System (PMS). This service provides CRUD operations for appointment data, integrates with patient and doctor services via Feign clients, and includes comprehensive scheduling conflict detection.

## üöÄ Features

- **Appointment CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete appointment records
- **Service Integration**: Uses Feign clients to communicate with patient and doctor services
- **Scheduling Conflict Detection**: Prevents double-booking of doctors
- **Date Range Queries**: Filter appointments by date ranges
- **Status Management**: Track appointment status (SCHEDULED, CANCELLED, COMPLETED)
- **Validation**: Comprehensive input validation with Jakarta Bean Validation
- **Service Discovery**: Integrated with Eureka for service registration
- **Health Checks**: Actuator endpoints for monitoring

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

- **Framework**: Spring Boot 3.5.3
- **Database**: MySQL 8.0
- **ORM**: Spring Data JPA with Hibernate
- **Service Discovery**: Netflix Eureka Client
- **Service Communication**: OpenFeign for HTTP clients
- **Testing**: JUnit 5 with Mockito and TestContainers

## üìã Prerequisites

- Java 21
- Maven 3.6+
- MySQL 8.0
- Eureka Discovery Server running on port 8761
- Patient Service running and registered with Eureka
- Doctor Service running and registered with Eureka

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

### 1. Database Setup

```sql
CREATE DATABASE appointment_db;
```

### 2. Configuration

Update `src/main/resources/application.yml`:

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/appointment_db
    username: your_username
    password: your_password
```

### 3. Run the Application

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The service will start on port 8083 and register with Eureka.

## üîß Service Integration

### Feign Clients

The service uses OpenFeign to communicate with other microservices:

- **PatientServiceClient**: Validates patient existence and retrieves patient details
- **DoctorServiceClient**: Validates doctor existence and retrieves doctor details

### JWT Token Forwarding

All Feign client calls forward the JWT token from the incoming request to maintain security context across services.

## üß™ Testing

### Run Tests

```bash
mvn test
```

### Test Coverage

The service includes comprehensive tests:
- **Controller Tests**: MockMvc tests for all endpoints
- **Service Tests**: Unit tests with Mockito for business logic
- **Integration Tests**: TestContainers for database testing
- **Feign Client Tests**: Mocked external service calls

### Test Database

Tests use TestContainers with MySQL for integration testing.

## üìä Monitoring

### Health Check

```bash
curl http://localhost:8083/actuator/health
```

### Metrics

```bash
curl http://localhost:8083/actuator/metrics
```
